NeoGeoPocket - Part of Jotego framework
---------------------------------------
This core requires a ROM file!

In case you had run the update all script (with roms enabled) there should be a ngp.zip in /media/fat/games/mame
Extract the file and rename the ngp_bios.ngp that is inside the zip to boot0.rom
Finally, copy it to /media/fat/games/NeoGeoPocket


How to load a game
------------------
There is a key assigned as power (up to you to define any key you want).
Once the core is loaded you have to open the menu (F12) load a cartridge and
then press the assigned power button of NeoGeo Pocket. 
When a white screen appears, press the assigned power button again for 
the game to load.

Whenever the settings menu appears, set the language of your choice and
any random date and time should be fine (it doesn't matter anyway).
