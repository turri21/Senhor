Requirements: A 32MB or higher SDRAM memory module compatible with MiSTer is required for most cores to work. (Recommended 128MB)

**WARNING: The memory module MUST BE connected to the inner slot, the one closer to the FPGA chip.**

**The outward side should be facing as the word discribes, outwards.**

**WARNING #2: A fan AND a heatsink are required (there are demanding cores such as the Minimig, ao486 etc where the chip is getting VERY hot).**
