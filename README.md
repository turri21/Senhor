Requirements: A 32MB or higher SDRAM memory module compatible with MiSTer is required for most cores to work. (Recommended 128MB)

**WARNING: The memory module MUST BE connected to the inner slot, the one closer to the FPGA chip.**

**The outward side should be facing as the word discribes, outwards. Please be extremely cautious about the correct orientation and proper installation of the memory module, otherwise you are risking to harm both the board and the module!!!**

**WARNING #2: A heatsink AND a fan are required (there are demanding cores such as the Minimig, ao486 etc where the chip is getting VERY hot).**

Finally, you are going to need a Micro SD card of minimum 2 GB and a custom Linux distribution flashed to it, such as [Mr. Fusion](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion) in order to be able to boot the system, browse the menu and load cores.
